- Don't attempt to run the Next.js application. You won't be able to do anything since pretty much the whole application is protected behind a login.
- Use Conventional Commits for your commit messages
- Add a changelog entry to `app/src/app/app/changelog/page.tsx` for any user-facing changes you make
- When changing the database Prisma schema, make sure to create a matching `migration.sql` file in the `app/prisma/migrations` folder. Also, make sure to mirror the schema changes between `app/prisma` and `pnpm-monorepo/packages/database/prisma`.
